\doxysubsection*{Project structure}

The modules employed by this project and their locations are listed in the {\ttfamily Files} page of this documentation. Accessing them will allow you to inspect all the functions they declare. Such modules are imported in three main Python scripts\+: 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily create\+\_\+db.\+py}\+: This script is used to create the S\+Q\+Lite database from scratch. 
\item {\ttfamily edit\+\_\+db.\+py}\+: With this file you can modify directly the database without the need to contact the Telegram A\+PI. 
\item {\ttfamily bot\+\_\+main.\+py}\+: Main file that runs the Telegram Bot and exposes it through the internet. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Have a look at {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md} to know how to properly use them.
